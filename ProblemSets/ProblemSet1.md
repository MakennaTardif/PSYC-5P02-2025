## Instructions
- To compete this Problem Set, use Markdown to edit a plaintext file to provide responses to the questions below. Your file should include markdown formatting where appropriate. Your grade will partly be based on your ability to provide explanations of the commands, so provide as much detail as possible. 
- For a tutorial on how to use Markdown, see: https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/. You can find some examples of all the syntax here  https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
-  You can also use a text editor > markdown coverter so you can see what the markdown file looks like, or there are specialized editors to preview markdown files. I used this web-based one here: https://dillinger.io/
- Your files must be uploaded to a git repository that is shared with me (user: SMEmrich) in order for the assignment to be considered submitted (see Question #7 below). Please be sure to contain all of your files in a directory (e.g., ProblemSet1/)

---

**Question 1:** a) What command would you use in a terminal shell if you wanted to list the files in your current directory, sorted in reverse order of when they were last edited? b) How would you expand on this command to also provide the date and time the file was last edited? c) Provide the manual description of at least one of the options required to produce this result.

**Question 2:** If your "home directory" is ```/users/yourname/```, provide three different commands that you can use to navigate from the directory ```/users/yourname/documents/``` to your home directory: 

**Question 3:** Provide the commands to do the following (in order):
* Make a directory called 'Data'
* Create a file called 'subj01.txt'
* Create four copies of the file you just created for subject 2 - 5, as well as 11.
* Move all of the files into the 'Data' directory
* Delete all .txt files from the Data directory **except** for subj11.txt

**Question 4:** Using the manual to learn about the function, create a _pipe_ that uses the ```tee``` command. Describe the task you're aiming to perform, and provide any and all code needed to complete it. Be sure to upload any files that you needed to run this code.

**Question 5:** Using the ```screen``` command, open up a screen. Using the ```history``` command and a pipe, write your command history to a file. Then exit the screen, and write your history to a new file again. Are these files the same? Why or why not? (Be sure to name them something obvious and upload both files as part of this assignment.)

**Question 6:** Complete the Introduction to Github tutorial at https://skills.github.com/. Screenshot the message you receive when you complete the tutorial, and insert the image into your markdown file. Hint: your image will need to exist in the same path as your saved markdown file, and your code will take the form of something like: ``![This is a picture of my screenshot](screenshot.jpg)``

**Question 7:** Go to the class respository (https://github.com/SMEmrich/PSYC-5P02-2025). Using the *fork* button at the top of the page, create a fork of the class respository.

After it has been forked, clone the repository to your computer using the code ``git clone git@github.com:[yourusername]/PSYC-5P02-2025.git`` (You may need a slightly different address if you are using https instead of ssh.) **Be sure to put this somewhere that makes sense** - this repo will have all course materials from this point on. Take a screenshot of your terminal window listing the files of your local repo. Add the screenshot to the markdown file. 

**Question 8:** Uplaod all files to github (inluding your markdown file and the files created in Question 5 - 7).  Be sure to add me to the repo as a collaborator under Settings (user: SMEmrich). Use the ```history``` command to write _only_ the commands you used to commit your files to git. (hint: you may need to use the ```head``` command --- or possibly the opposite of ```head```). What was the command you used to the create the final file?. Lastly, commit that file and your final markdown file with responses to all questions to the github repository.
